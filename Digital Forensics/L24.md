# Steps

* I'm going to be installing the Digital Forensics Framework from Github, but before I can begin installing the DFF I need to install its dependencies.
* I need to install 4 different depencies beforehand: libbfio, libpff, libewf, libvshadow from their appropriate githubs.
* The build process for [libbfio](https://github.com/libyal/libbfio/wiki/Building) is in that link.
* The build process for [libpff](https://github.com/libyal/libpff/wiki/Building) is in that link.
* I've decided to switch to making a new vm with amd kali linux 2016, as it comes with DFF installed and there were many issues caused by trying to get dff on other systems.
