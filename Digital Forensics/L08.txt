L06 Xavier Beatrice
To begin this assignment I installed Sleuth Kit Autopsy onto my windows VM
After installing, I'll start the program and begin a new case.
I'll name the case L-08 and leave it in the set default directory and \Documents\Autopsy Cases\
I'll then name the case and input my examiner information
I'll select the Generate new host name based on data source name option.
We'll be choosing the Data source type which is Disk Image or VM File
I'll then look for the recommended image file 8-jpeg-search.dd
I'll load up the image into autopsy and give it the MD5 of the image as well
I'll leave the ingest configuration as default and then finish the case construction

After running into a roadblock, I'm going to restart the process on debian.
I'll update and install the autopsy via apt, and then run it via terminal
I'll create a case next and name it L-08, give it an appropriate description, and give it my name
Next I'll add a host, give it the default hostname and no description, I'll feed it EST as the timezone.
The md5hash of the 8-jpeg-search.dd file is 9bdb9c76b80e90d155806a1fc784db5

After running into another roadblock with the image file, 8-jpeg-search.dd, not properly loading and getting an error.
I'll attempt case 2 with windows.
I'll name it Case L08-2 and give it the number 08-2

I'll let it generate a host, and select the Disk Image file type and give it 8-jpeg-search.dd as a file.
I'll change the timezone to gmt-6:00
There's no other things to change so I finish the data source add.
