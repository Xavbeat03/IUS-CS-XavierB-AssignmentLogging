L06 Xavier Beatrice
To begin this assignment I installed Sleuth Kit Autopsy onto my windows VM
After installing, I'll start the program and begin a new case.
I'll name the case L-08 and leave it in the set default directory and \Documents\Autopsy Cases\
I'll then name the case and input my examiner information
I'll select the Generate new host name based on data source name option.
We'll be choosing the Data source type which is Disk Image or VM File
I'll then look for the recommended image file 8-jpeg-search.dd
