Lesson 5
This lesson is mainly focused on creating the appropriate testing environments. It also brings up the importance of logging.

After reading through the first part of chapter 2, I realized I needed to have the environment set up in a virtual machine ahead of time.
So to begin with I'll be creating an ubuntu and windows vm. I'll need to ensure that virtualization is available on my pc first though.
I have enabled virtualization through the bios of my PC.

I installed virtualbox as my relevant vming software following along with this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJs70jQi7Wk
I installed it through pacman.
Next I'll need to create a Debian LTS os and a windows 11 one.
To create the windows virtual machine I downloaded the appropriate iso from the microsoft website and put it into the vbox vm creation tool, I have created user information and am assigning appropriate memory and processor amount.

I also wanted to set up the virtual disks on a non-main drive so I set up the apropriate mounting mechanisms in my fstab file.
After setting up the proper mounting I need to move the vm over, which required me to reset the permissions of the drive folders. 
I'm currently getting an error where it cannot enumerate USB devices, currently researching a fix to this issue.
I fixed the above issue by adding $USER to the vboxusers group, and grabbing the vbox extensions from the AUR page and restarting the desktop.
I noticed I'm getting an error with the unattended setup, and have determined that the needed files are missing, therefore I need to verify or reinstall virtualbox.
After installing the needed setup files from the AUR and recreating the VM, I've booted the vm and begun the installation process.
After some time the VM opened appropriately and correctly showed the number of processes and ram that was passed to it.

To continue I've grabbed the debian 12 iso from debian.org and also added it to a vm in vbox with similar settings to the windows 11 vm. I was then able to boot it immediately.
To fix a mouse issue that was occurring I'm switching the USB controller for the Debian vm to xHCI.
Continuing I'll follow chapter 2 of the book Digital Forensics with Open Source Tools to setup the vm's.

To get the first package "build-essentials" I needed to switch to root with su root, and then use apt-get to install build-essential. It was already installed.
I first check if perl is installed, it is so I ensure that the version is after 5.10.1 and I run perl -MCPAN -e shell and run through with the default configuration.
