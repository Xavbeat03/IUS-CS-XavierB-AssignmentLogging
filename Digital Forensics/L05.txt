Lesson 5
This lesson is mainly focused on creating the appropriate testing environments. It also brings up the importance of logging.

After reading through the first part of chapter 2, I realized I needed to have the environment set up in a virtual machine ahead of time.
So to begin with I'll be creating an ubuntu and windows vm. I'll need to ensure that virtualization is available on my pc first though.
I have enabled virtualization through the bios of my PC.

I installed virtualbox as my relevant vming software following along with this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJs70jQi7Wk
I installed it through pacman.
Next I'll need to create a Debian LTS os and a windows 11 one.
To create the windows virtual machine I downloaded the appropriate iso from the microsoft website and put it into the vbox vm creation tool, I have created user information and am assigning appropriate memory and processor amount.

I also wanted to set up the virtual disks on a non-main drive so I set up the apropriate mounting mechanisms in my fstab file.
After setting up the proper mounting I need to move the vm over, which required me to reset the permissions of the drive folders. 
I'm currently getting an error where it cannot enumerate USB devices, currently researching a fix to this issue.
